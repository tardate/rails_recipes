	Bulwayo, Republic of Elbonia.

	MY PLEASURE,

	This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your
	unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction requiring
	maximum confidence. Though this approach appears desperate,I can assure
	you that whatever questions you would need to ask or any other thing you
	will need to know regarding this proposal, will be adequately answered
	to give you a clearer understanding of it so as to arrive at a
	successful conclusion.

	No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please i employ you
	to observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction
	would be most profitable for both of us. Note also that we shall require
	your assistance to invest our share in your country.

	Thanks and Regards,
	Mr. N'Dugu Wanaskamya
