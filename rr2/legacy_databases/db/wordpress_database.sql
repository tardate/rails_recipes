We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half.

We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id=\"more-177\"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half. By default it is disk-based, but there   is already a plugin to use memcached and we expect more are on their way. We&#8217;ve only begun to   tap into this.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin Hooks Galore</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve added hooks for plugin authors wherever we could think to,   so what you&#8217;re able to do in the new system is pretty dramatic. Ne features like the WYSIWYG   and the inline uploader are completely pluggable and can be replaced entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Import Framework</strong> &#8212; The new import framework allows you to create an importer with about   a third of the code you used to need, and it can have a consistent interface with no extra   work.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Functions</strong> &#8212; Themes can now include a functions.php file that will now be loaded   like a plugin attached to the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme preview images</strong> &#8212; You can now include a screenshot of the theme with the download   so in the WP interface your users will see a quick preview of what it looks like.</li>\n<li><strong>Hundreds and Hundreds of Bug Fixes</strong> &#8212; <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0\">2.0 has hundreds of tracked bugs and   enhancements</a>, many that are very subtle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have noticed our design has changed quite a bit.

My wife and I use Nextel cell service (now owned by Sprint), and I had recently registered on the Sprint web site for their online account management, so getting email from them wasn\'t a surprise. However, the subject of the message caught my eye in a curious way: \"Attn: Dougal Gunter - Sprint Ambassador Invite\".\n</p>\n<p>\nHmmm... First of all, they\'ve made the common mistake of thinking that my name is \"Dougal Gunter\". And second of all, what\'s this about a \"Sprint Ambassador Invite\"? And lastly, the email was sent to my regular email address, not the one I used to register for the account management stuff. Let\'s take a look and see what this is about.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Dougal,</p>\n<p>\nThe Sprint Ambassador Team recently visited Dougal.gunters.org and wants to invite you to participate in our Ambassador Program.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nAs a qualified participant blah, blah, blah, Sprint Power Vision phone with 6 months of free voice and data service, blah, blah, blah, apply here, blah.\n</p>\n<p>\nHmm.

There are a few significant differences.</p>\n<p>For one, it doesn&#8217;t use EzStatic to integrate with WordPress.  For another, some of the wiki syntax is a bit different.  (Yeah, I know, &#8220;Eek.&#8221;)  And it&#8217;s a bit more flexible than last time.</p>\n<p>There are a few cool things about MicroWiki.  Let me list a few things that MicroWiki does for me that will probably cause me no end of support questions like, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I get MicroWiki to do what you said it would on your blog?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>MicroWiki integrates with WordPress.</strong>  In this most recent pass, I switched around my philosophy as to how this would be done.  &#8220;Integration&#8221; for our purposes means this:  MicroWiki uses WordPress&#8217; database connection and user authentication, and has access to any functions that are usually defined when accessing a WordPress page.</p>\n<p>So when you install MicroWiki and choose the &#8220;WordPress&#8221; User Registration option, it&#8217;ll create its tables in your WordPress database, and it will allow only the users with &#8220;wiki_edit&#8221; capabilities to edit your wiki.  And if you do something crazy like include a PHP file into one of your wiki pages, it will have access to all of the WordPress functions.  Depending how you look at it, this could be easier than building a whole plugin to create a page.</p>\n<p><strong>MicroWiki has new rewriter functionality.</strong>  Taking a cue from how WordPress manages rewriting (but not using WordPress&#8217; WP_Rewrite class), rewriting is handled internally when a URL is passed to it from a generic rewrite rule.  Also having some more experience with mod_rewrite by this time, a sample .htaccess file comes along with the installer.  Friendly URLs are now much easier to implement.</p>\n<p><strong>MicroWiki has no templates.</strong>  This concept is a hard one to get across at first.  Most wikis load a template file from disk, then take the content that you submitted to the database and insert it into that template.  How do you edit the template?  Well, you open up a text editor (outside the wiki) and edit the template.  That&#8217;s&#8230; um, convenient.  Not.</p>\n<p>MicroWiki uses a formatting tag to insert page content into a template that is stored in the database.  You can edit the template inside the wiki.  So if you don&#8217;t like the way that the template is constructed, you can edit it inside the wiki without opening a text editor or downloading/uploading template file changes.</p>\n<p>MicroWiki supports a content-type tag, too, so your CSS files aren&#8217;t in some file on the server, either.  They&#8217;re in the wiki.  You can edit them in the wiki.</p>\n<p>You can specify a different &#8220;format&#8221; (that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re called in MicroWiki) for any page, just by including a macro, like {{format:myformat}}.  Instead of displaying the page content of that page in the default format, MicroWiki will use the &#8220;Format:myformat&#8221; page as the page layout, inserting the content on that page wherever it finds the {{Special:pagecontent}} tag in the format page.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s all very confusing, but if you&#8217;re following along, I think you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Whoa, cool!&#8221;  Either that or, &#8220;You&#8217;re insane!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>MicroWiki has an image gallery built in.</strong>  Wait.  What?  I&#8217;ll say that again&#8230;  <em>MicroWiki has an image gallery built in.</em>  It&#8217;s a sucky image gallery, and mostly it sucks because nobody ever knew it was there to give feedback for it.  But it is.  So what&#8217;s the deal?</p>\n<p>Well, the default editing page (have I mentioned that the editing page format can be edited, too?) has a frame at the bottom that lets you upload new image files.  When you upload a file, it automatically inserts the macro tag necessary to display the uploaded image.  You can choose some properties for the tag, like the alignment and whether you would like a thumbnail instead of the full-sized image.  The image automatically links to a unique wiki page for that image, to which you can add new content.</p>\n<p>In the frame, there is an option for selecting a gallery for the image.  You can create new galleries via FTP simply by creating a new directory in the wiki&#8217;s &#8220;images&#8221; directory, and then uploading a bunch of images.</p>\n<p>How do you display a gallery?  You add a macro that specifies the gallery name.  MicroWiki displays thumbnails of all of the gallery images, and adds some fancy-ish (ok, it&#8217;s not that fancy) that displays the image a little bigger when you click on a thumbnail.  If you then click on the bigger image, you go directly to the dedicated image page.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s assuming any of that actually works.</p>\n<p><strong>MicroWiki can include stuff.</strong>  It might be difficult to convince you of the utility of this, but I&#8217;ll give it a shot.</p>\n<p>If the wiki configuration allows it, you can use a macro to include a php script&#8217;s output at some point in the wiki page output.  One handy example of what you can do with this is include a file that fetches and displays RSS news.  If you put that in your wiki&#8217;s sidebar, you can extend the functionality of the wiki significantly.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because the wiki has already created all of the objects needed for database access and authentication, you don&#8217;t have to code any of that stuff into your scripts.  All you need to do is create the script with the functionality you want, save it near the wiki, then create a new wiki page that includes that file.  Instant object access!</p>\n<p><strong>So where is this monstrosity?</strong>  Hmm&#8230;  Well, it&#8217;s <em>only 136kb</em>, so it&#8217;s a really small monster.  But yeah.</p>\n<p>Before you go off in an excited rush to get the thing, let me come clean a little (as if you couldn&#8217;t tell):</p>\n<blockquote><p>This thing isn&#8217;t tested for regular people to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What I mean is, it should install simply.

You create a list of events, and Countdown outputs those events on your blog.  The events can recur, so you can put in single dates like &#8220;06-04 Owen&#8217;s Birthday (Observed)&#8221; and it will show that on the same day every year.</p>\n<p>There are some more complex recurring settings, too, like the ever helpful:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1st sun apr Daylight Savings Starts</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note that this event recurs on the first Sunday of every April.</p>\n<p>Previous users will recognize these settings from before, but I have added a few new little things to sweten up the plugin.<br />\n<a id=\"more-2273\"></a><br />\nOn small thing is a new set of date modifiers.  You can now say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>2 days before 10-25</p></blockquote>\n<p>or:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the mon after 08-02</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is especially useful when using it with the new Easter date:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the fri before easter Good Friday</p></blockquote>\n<p>But those are just the new date settings.  In addition to those, there is a whole new administration panel for setting Countdown options.</p>\n<p>On the configuration page, you can set the output format for events and dates, and also edit the event list.</p>\n<p>Using the new formatting options, you could (for example) output the date as part of an image URL, and display a graphic instead of just the date.  Or you could feed the date to some javascript code (that you create) to have it render your dates specially based on criteria of your choosing.</p>\n<p>You can also use the formatting to change the dates for your locale, which was a big requested feature.  You&#8217;re no longer locked into the format provided with Countdown, and can now specify your own format using the <a href=\"http://php.net/date\">PHP date()</a> format characters.</p>\n<p>One more interesting thing on the new admin panel is the &#8220;Add Event&#8221; form.  It helps you create new events for the event list without having to remember the formatting.  (Was it really that hard to learn, anyway?)  Not all of the options are available there, but the most used ones are.  Everything else is written up in the documentation on RedAlt.</p>\n<p>Finally, the plugin has included support for the beta of <a href=\"http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/installer-the-plugin/\">Matt Read&#8217;s Installer plugin</a>.

You create a list of events, and Countdown outputs those events on your blog.  The events can recur, so you can put in single dates like &#8220;06-04 Owen&#8217;s Birthday (Observed)&#8221; and it will show that on the same day every year.</p>\n<p>There are some more complex recurring settings, too, like the ever helpful:</p>\n<blockquote><p>1st sun apr Daylight Savings Starts</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note that this event recurs on the first Sunday of every April.</p>\n<p>Previous users will recognize these settings from before, but I have added a few new little things to sweten up the plugin.<br />\n<a id=\"more-2273\"></a><br />\nOn small thing is a new set of date modifiers.  You can now say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>2 days before 10-25</p></blockquote>\n<p>or:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the mon after 08-02</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is especially useful when using it with the new Easter date:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the fri before easter Good Friday</p></blockquote>\n<p>But those are just the new date settings.  In addition to those, there is a whole new administration panel for setting Countdown options.</p>\n<p>On the configuration page, you can set the output format for events and dates, and also edit the event list.</p>\n<p>Using the new formatting options, you could (for example) output the date as part of an image URL, and display a graphic instead of just the date.  Or you could feed the date to some javascript code (that you create) to have it render your dates specially based on criteria of your choosing.</p>\n<p>You can also use the formatting to change the dates for your locale, which was a big requested feature.  You&#8217;re no longer locked into the format provided with Countdown, and can now specify your own format using the <a href=\"http://php.net/date\">PHP date()</a> format characters.</p>\n<p>One more interesting thing on the new admin panel is the &#8220;Add Event&#8221; form.  It helps you create new events for the event list without having to remember the formatting.  (Was it really that hard to learn, anyway?)  Not all of the options are available there, but the most used ones are.  Everything else is written up in the documentation on RedAlt.</p>\n<p>Finally, the plugin has included support for the beta of <a href=\"http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/installer-the-plugin/\">Matt Read&#8217;s Installer plugin</a>.  The Installer lets you install plugins directly from their zip files, and manages their files.  You can easily remove plugins that you&#8217;ve installed with the Installer plugin.  </p>\n<p>Also - the main reason why I bring this up - the Installer will tell you if there are updates available for your plugins, and will automatically download and install them on a button click.

Yes, you read right, a cool hundred thousand. In respect for that milestone, would like to go on record as a paid subscriber of Akismet as of next month. Weblogtoolscollection.com has seen its share of spam and was mentioned in one of the blog updates of Akismet with numbers hovering in the 99.51% comment spam range. Akismet has served me well barring a few offbeat social spam comments and I feel that the developers deserve to be rewarded for their efforts and their service (though I wish I would make anywhere near the money that paid subscribers are supposed to be making from their blogs).</p>\n	<p>I was in the spam mitigation business with <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/search-beta.php?q=cspam&#038;submit=Search\">CSPAM</a> and <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/search-beta.php?q=cspam&#038;submit=Search\">Three Strikes</a> and though the service could only handle a few thousand blogs on my old server, it was quite a trip. It mostly managed itself and I was almost completely spam free during the time I used it. Even though I <em>would like to think</em> that CSPAM was the spark that led to Akismet (Matt and I talked briefly about CSPAM), I am sure the Akismet engine is much more sophisticated and optimized (and not written in PHP like CSPAM). The numbers and processing power needs can be astronomical from my experience. In about nine months CSPAM caught and removed about 700,000 spam comments, had a 10,000 word vocabulary and learned about ten comments a minute. In comparison, Akismet has caught 3,812,040 spam comments and growing and shows absolutely no signs of slowing down. Kudos to the developers.</p>\n	<p>In short, spam is down, real comments are up and I am a happy camper. I would encourage everyone to try Akismet for their Spam needs. I also urge heavy users to put their money where their Spam was and sign up as a subscribed user.\n</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 15:23:42 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Mark\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:2001:\"<p>As of last week, <a href=\"http://akismet.com\">Akismet</a> had blocked 100,000 spam comments from this blog.

Even though I <em>would like to think</em> that CSPAM was the spark that led to Akismet (Matt and I talked briefly about CSPAM), I am sure the Akismet engine is much more sophisticated and optimized (and not written in PHP like CSPAM). The numbers and processing power needs can be astronomical from my experience. In about nine months CSPAM caught and removed about 700,000 spam comments, had a 10,000 word vocabulary and learned about ten comments a minute. In comparison, Akismet has caught 3,812,040 spam comments and growing and shows absolutely no signs of slowing down. Kudos to the developers.</p>\n	<p>In short, spam is down, real comments are up and I am a happy camper. I would encourage everyone to try Akismet for their Spam needs. I also urge heavy users to put their money where their Spam was and sign up as a subscribed user.\n</p>\";}i:40;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:57:\"Weblog Tools Collection: miniBlog : a Theme for Wordpress\";s:4:\"guid\";s:84:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/02/14/miniblog-a-theme-for-wordpress/\";s:4:\"link\";s:60:\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP?m=615\";s:11:\"description\";s:591:\"<p><a href=\"http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/my-projects/mini-blog-theme-for-wordpress/\">miniBlog</a>: tiny, light, soft grey, rather elegant and clean theme for Wordpress.

Dashboard is fun and I can see it becoming a useful tool for things like tracking packages with FedEx and UPS, tracking flights (!yay!), etc.  I love the dictionary/thesaurus widget, and I downloaded a lovely hula girl and the \"creaturesinmyhead.com widgets last night.  I was amazed at how quickly new widgets started popping up last night.

EEEK!  For my birthday, I got something I\'ve wanted for a long time.  An Aquarium!  I was really happy and looking forward to adding some fishy friends to our household.   I found a great looking tank that would fit well in the house and I could sit next to it and enjoy the sound of the running water and watching the fish swim swim swim.  Here\'s the tank:\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/aquarium/talltank.jpg\"/></center>\r\n\r\nWe bought it the day before my birthday so that I could set it up and then add fish to it the next day.  It takes about 4 to 6 weeks for the tank to completely \"cycle\" and be hospitable for most fish.  You can cycle the tank with a hardy species like the Zebra Danios I chose to cycle with.  I\'ve since learned that this is quite stressful for the fish and you can cycle the tank without putting the fish through it.  Well, let me tell you.  I love the danios, they\'re fun fish and believe it or not (Chad thinks I\'m crazy) have a lot of personality.  Problem is, they\'re asskickers.  They\'ve pretty much killed every other fish I\'ve put in the tank with them since the cycle completed.  I\'ve joked for a long time that our house and yard are basically a small animal version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre *see footnote* and the danios are only helping re-inforce that theory.  The Solution?  Return the danios to the store and see if I can get some Angelfish to survive in the tank.  I\'ll be doing that on Monday.  I hate to do it, but I don\'t want to kill any more fish and I can\'t get anything but danios to live in the tank as long as these 5 serial killer fish are in there.  Angelfish can grow to be about 6 inches tall and need a pretty big tank to feel comfortable, my tank will be a perfect fit for them.  I\'m looking forward to bringing them home.  \r\n\r\nAbout a month ago I bought another tank.  I know it seems crazy, but I did.  Apparently this is very common in fishkeeping, you get one tank, catch \"the bug\" and many many tanks are added to your collection.  Here\'s the new beauty:\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/aquarium/bowtank.jpg\"/></center>\r\n\r\nI got it setup and cycled in about 3-1/2 weeks.  I used a biological additive to get the cycle going and \"fed\" the tank everyday to help speed up the proccess.  I\'ve currently got 3 cory cats and 5 gold tetras swimming in it now.  The large driftwood in the center has got some live plants(Java Moss) rubber banded to it, once they\'re established the rubber band will come off.  Here\'s a photo of the tetras:\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"images/aquarium/tetras.jpg\"/></center>\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to take pictures of fish.  It\'s hard to take pictures of aquariums, period.  You can\'t use a flash because it reflects off the glass, and for some reason, you can\'t get the fish to sit still.  Imagine.  The tetras are pretty interested in me.  I know, I know, sounds crazy, but if I sit close to the tank and watch them, they\'ll come over and watch me too.  They\'re a really nice schooling tetra and quite pretty.  They\'re very shiny and their scales shimmer and are very metallic gold.  They\'re small now but grow very quickly and will eventually be about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches.  (two of these guys look a little silver to me and seem to have a faint black stripe that the others don\'t have, maybe I have two black neon tetras too? or some kind of hybrid?) Chad really wanted to see some big fish, so he was really disappointed when he came home to these tiny guys.  Hopefully the angels will make him happy when he sees those.  \r\n\r\n*footnote* - - We have 4 dogs.  One of them is a retired racing Greyhound.  He used to chase a furry thing around and around in a circle for a living.  He never got to catch it.  Until he came home to our house.  Suddenly he was able to catch the running furry thing.  I think that was the happiest day of his life.  He sure didn\'t understand why I wasn\'t as happy as he was.  Since then it had been a pretty steady stream of small animal deaths.  Eventually I think they were all killed or established some kind of early warning system to warn off the new neighborhood critters from the \"Yard of Death\".  Occasionally something gets in, usually they\'re able to escape through some strategically place holes, sometimes they fight back as in the case of the groundhog that wouldn\'t die, sometimes they don\'t make it.  We don\'t like it, we try to avoid it whenever possible, but the poor dog is only doing what centuries of breeding and 5 years of racing has taught him.  It\'s almost as though we have our very own National Geographic safari park in our backyard. Cycle of life and all that. After Greg the Greyhound came Arnie.  Arnie can catch birds.  He also really likes to dig up moles.  One day I looked out in tbe backyard and Arnie was happily tossing this brown lump in the air and catching it and tossing it again.  In my head I heard \"WHEE!!! WHEE!!!!\"  Upon further investigation the lump turned out to be a gigantic mole he\'d finally dug up.  The hole was so deep he could stand in it and we could barely see him.  YaY.  \r\n\r\nSo, on that note, somehow the addition of some murderous Zebra Danios isn\'t all that suprising.

I\'m really lucky to have such a great LFS (Live Fish Shop) so close to the house with not only great healthy fish, but helpful and responsible employees (for the most part).  \r\n\r\nI brought home 4 gorgeous new Angels for my 44 gallon pentagonal aquarium.  \r\n\r\nHere\'s a shot of one of my new, let\'s call her canary yellow, Angels:\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<center><img src=\"images/aquarium/yellowangel.jpg\"/></center>\r\n<br />\r\nI\'m calling it a her because she\'s so dainty compared to the other three and a bit smaller in size.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also got a really great shot of the other three fellows that came home with her(?):\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<center><img src=\"images/aquarium/3angels.jpg\"/></center>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nTwo of these guys are called \"Clown\" Angels.  They\'re very iridescent and with good water quality and good food that should increase with age.  The yellow girl should become a brilliant gold, although I\'m hoping she\'ll retain some of her nice yellow color as well, and the biggest guy I haven\'t been able to put my finger on what his color variation is, but it\'s possible he\'s what they call a calico.  We\'ll see...give me a few more days to watch them and do some research on the internet and I\'ll have some answers for you. (not that any of you probably care much...hehe)\r\n\r\nWish me luck, I\'ll need it.

My father-in-law came over this morning and helped me schlep my stuff over to the studio.  This afternoon I went back and started moving everything around.  I managed to get everything put away pretty quickly and organized the way I think I\'ll like it... which led to actually getting some clay ready and breakin\' that sucker in.  Pretty GREAT!  That nice white shiny wheel you saw in the pictures is no more.. It\'s officially muddy. A dream came true today.  :)  Pictures soon!

I saw the most beautiful fish called a Ram there.  He was not very big, but he was so coloful and interesting that I was instantly enamored.  So, I started setting up and aquarium thinking maybe one day if I was really serious I could bring one or two home.<br />\r\n \r\n\r\nLast week, I brought a tiny pair home.  Turns out I got a male and female purely by chance.  They\'re still very young, but growing quickly, two days ago they laid some eggs..  they didn\'t take, but if this keeps up, I might be up to my eyeballs in baby fish soon... EEK!

I panicked! Oh My God!  6 years in one city!  That\'s a really long time for me...  I\'m not sure I\'m ready for this kind of commitment!  We could very well stay here for the rest of our lives and probably be pretty happy.  WE NEED TO MOVE!  That was my thought proccess.  I didn\'t really seriously consider moving it was just one of those moments you have when you\'re mind is quiet and you examine your situation.  \r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, here we are 2 or 3 months later and we\'re moving!  Chad has taken a dream job and it happens to be in a dream place.  We\'re moving to Denver, Colorado this fall.  We\'re both really excited and looking forward to a new house and new city.  We\'re also sad to leave a great city and great friends.  Luckily with the internet, the telephone and transportation, we can keep in touch and maintain lasting bonds with people even though we\'re not in the same city any more.  Don\'t look at it like you\'re losing your friends, look at it like you\'re getting a new place to go on vacation.

Many times the bed was the focus of his frustration when things didn\'t go his way or he couldn\'t fit his massive body into it.  Sadly it perished some time ago.  \r\n<br />\r\nI recently brought home a nice shiny new even smaller bed for the chihuahuas.. they insist on sharing at all times.
